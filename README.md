# Advent of code - 2024

https://adventofcode.com/2024

Second year doing it. This year, I am going to try to do it all in rust... Let's see. Not the ideal language for this, but it should be a great learning exercise.

For reference, [last year](https://github.com/dprophete/advent-2023) I started using **python**, then after a few days I restarted from day 1 using **elixir**, and after finishing it all in elixir, I redid the first 5 days in **rust**...


## running

Edit [src/main.rs](./src/main.rs) and change the day to the one you want to run. Then `cargo run` is your friend.
