# Advent of code - 2024

Second year doing it. This year, I am going to try to do it all in rust... Let's see. Not the ideal language for this, but it should be a great learning exercise.

For reference, [last year](https://github.com/dprophete/advent-2023) I started using **python**, then after a few days I restarted from day 1 using **elixir**, and after finishing it all in elixir, I redid the first 5 days in **rust**... Definitely a fun learning experience.


## running

You should be able to cd into any dir, and simply `cargo run`
